# Business Activities
 
## What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
 
 
Lemonade is trying to change the insurance industry and make it a more positive experience by eliminating paperwork and the hassle of going through a claim. Schreiber is a tech wiz who saw a better way to go about obtaining insurance "So, if you’re looking to evolve your own organization, get an outsider’s perspective"-schreiber
 
## Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
 
Lemonade mainly targets millennial, tech-savvy individuals with relatively few assets—customers who were less attractive to traditional insurers who had costly, labor-intensive operations.
 
The Millennial generation is the biggest in US history—even bigger than the Baby Boom. Millennials have grown up in a time of rapid change, giving them a set of priorities and expectations sharply different from previous generations. Millennials make up individuals born between 1980 -2000. Millennials are also the generation that carry the most student loan debt and are the most plugged in . Millennials are a unique case, with lower employment and income levels, most millennials have put off previous generational priorities such as marriage and home ownership, making lemonade a great insurance option as their creative marketing tactics using digital ads appeal to the tech driven individual and offer a low cost premium to the debt carrying generation. 
 
 
## What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
 
  
  
   Rather than sell policies backed by established insurers Lemonade would become a licensed carrier itself, retaining claim liability on its own balance sheet. That meant Lemonade could pay claims faster and operate under a unique business model that has become a pillar of its marketing. In addition, the company takes 25% of insurance premium revenue for administrative costs and potential profits. The other 75% is used to fund customer claims, buy reinsurance (laying off some risk) and pay certain taxes and fees, with anything left going to charities that customers choose
 
   The social-compact pitch: Lemonade can’t profit from denying legit claims, and customers making bogus claims are cheating charity, not some greedy insurer.
 
 
## Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.) ##
 
    Big data and machine learning are deeply integrated into Lemonade's product and internal processes, Some of those innovations include Lemonade’s AI Maya bot which guide users across the platform , personalized coverage , generates quotes , facultates payments and sells policies! Lemonade also have a claims AI claims bot names JIM. Jim assist users with filing and managing claims without human involvement .
 
 
 
 
# Landscape
 
## What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
 
Lemonade is an insurance company and their form would fall under insurTech.
 
## What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
 
Lemonade has changed the insurance landscape through the use of AI. Lemonade is not only able to file, manage, and facilitate claims , but it can also pay them out in a matter of hours. Forbes also illustrated the advanced fraud detection through the use of algorithms which help in detecting  and flagging suspicious claims.
 
## What are the other major companies in this domain?
 
Next Insurance
Zipari
MetroMile
Corvus Insurance
Policygenius
Clearcover
 
The following companies touch different sectors of the insurTech domain, with some focuses on business cyber security and risk mitigation and other on consumer product such as health care/renters and homeowners insurance/ vehicle act.
 
# Results
 
## What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  
   Automation  allows Lemonade to offer policies at a very low price: renters insurance starting at $5 a month and homeowners starting at $25. On the review site Clearsurance, Lemonade ranks second in customer satisfaction for renters insurance, behind only USAA.
  
 
 
## What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
 
   Most insurance companies can compare the ratio of pays in claims divided by the premiums collected. in 2017 lemonade ratios were an unsustainable 166%, compared to 65% to 70% for large insurers. By the first quarter of 2019, its loss ratio had dropped to a healthier 86% due to an increase of users from 2017 to 2019 which helped train a lemonade algorithm which determines whether a claim should be paid without human involvement.
 
   The number of customers reached in 4 years compared to larger insurance companies is also incredible. It took just over four years for Lemonade to reach 1 million customers. That's much faster than some of these legacy players. I think it took State Farm two decades to do the same things.
 
## How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
 
   
   Lemonade has been around longer than most insurtech companies. While most insurtech companies focus on the launch of one product ( auto insurance with root or homeowners insurance with hippo) Lemonade has a few different products already. They have renters, homeowners, pet insurance, and term life, and they are moving into auto insurance.
  
   Many of the insurtech startups still require the help of traditional insurers to handle underwriting and manage catastrophic risk. Because lemonade has been around longer, they have the data advantage that has refined the AI bots who manage the service.
 
 
# Recommendations
 
## If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
 
   Lemonade is currently on the right path in expanding their services. The addition of pet, life, and auto not only appeals to their targeted audience , millennials, but it centralized all services into one easy to use and AI managed application.
 
   IF i were to advise on a service , i would like to see lemonade's expand its client and improve the dental, health and vision insurance sector with employers
 
## Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
 
   Lemonades AI bots make it extremely easy to get a low insurance quote and offers a great first time user experience. As an individual who did not grow up in the United States, I felt very intimidated by insurance companies , especially when it came to enrolling in benefits in my workplace. If lemonade could incorporate their AI technology and offer a guided experience to aiding users in selecting the right insurance plan , more employees would opt for benefits.
 
## What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
 
   Just like how lemonade AI recommends and caters policies based on data collected , it could do the same on an employer benefits scale with recommending and offering more affordable benefits packages such as health,dental and vision all at the palm of your hand.
 
## Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
 
   Businesses are always looking for a solution to retain employees. Having an easy to use Ai driven system would further employee engagement by lowering the paywall most employees encounter when enrolling in benefits . By offering employer-sponsored health insurance, businesses are supporting the employee's health and well-being, creating a caring, positive company culture.
